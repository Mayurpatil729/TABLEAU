## NETFLIX DASHBOARD 

**Step 1: Data Preparation**
Ensure you have the relevant Netflix data in a structured format, such as CSV or Excel. Your dataset should include information about shows/movies, viewership, genres, release dates, etc.

**Step 2: Connecting Data to Tableau**
1. Open Tableau Desktop.
2. Click on "Connect to Data" and select your data source (CSV, Excel, etc.).
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to connect and import your data into Tableau.

**Step 3: Building the Dashboard**
1. Drag and drop the necessary fields from your data into the "Rows" and "Columns" shelves to create the visualizations you need. For example:
   - Drag "Viewership" to the Rows shelf to create a bar chart showing viewership numbers.
   - Drag "Genre" to the Columns shelf to create a bar chart showing the distribution of genres.

2. To create interactive filters, drag relevant dimensions (e.g., "Genre," "Release Date") to the "Filters" shelf.

3. To add more visualizations, drag other dimensions or measures to the workspace, and choose the appropriate chart type (line chart, pie chart, etc.).

4. Customize the visualizations by adjusting colors, labels, and other properties to enhance the dashboard's appearance and readability.

5. Arrange the visualizations on the dashboard canvas to create a cohesive layout. You can also add text boxes or images to provide context or branding elements.

**Step 4: Adding Interactivity**
1. Create actions to enable interactivity between visualizations. For example, you can set up a dashboard filter action that allows viewers to click on a genre bar in one chart and see how it affects viewership in another chart.

**Step 5: Dashboard Formatting**
1. Format the dashboard layout to make it visually appealing and user-friendly. Use consistent colors, fonts, and sizing throughout.

2. Test the dashboard's functionality and ensure that all the visualizations and interactive elements work as intended.

**Step 6: Save and Publish**
1. Save your completed dashboard as a Tableau workbook (TWBX) file.

2. If you want to share the dashboard with others, you can publish it to Tableau Server or Tableau Public (if you have an account). This allows you to share the interactive dashboard with a wider audience.

Keep in mind that this is a basic guide to building a Netflix dashboard on Tableau. Depending on your data and specific requirements, you can add more advanced features and visualizations to create a more comprehensive and insightful dashboard.
